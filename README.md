phpAnvil Framework v3.0
=======================

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/phpanvil/phpanvil/v/stable.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/phpanvil/phpanvil) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phpanvil/phpAnvil.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phpanvil/phpAnvil)

While most other frameworks focus on websites and simple applications, the
phpAnvil framework was designed for SaaS and enterprise level web applications.


Community Standards
-------------------

It's very important to maintain code that is consistent and easily adoptable by
other developers within the PHP community.  Most phpAnvil applications are
developed in teams, which these standards remove the risk of different coding
styles between various developers within the team.

Most of our standards are based on the work from the
[PHP Framework Interoperability Group][1]:


- [PSR-0][2]: Autoloading Standard
- [PSR-1][3]: Basic Coding Standard
- [PSR-2][4]: Coding Style Guide
- [PSR-3][5]: Logger Interface


API Documentation
-----------------

[phpAnvil API Documentation][12] is generated using [phpDox][10].
